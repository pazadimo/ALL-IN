This repository contains the Pytorch\DGL implementation and the used graph embeddings in "ALL-IN: A Local GLobal Graph-based DIstillatioN Model for Representation Learning of Gigapixel Histopathology Images With Application In Cancer Risk Assessment" paper, accepted at MICCAI 2023.

## Note
- We are currently in the process of code and data cleaning. Both will be ready by the MICCAI 2023 conference. Stay tuned!
