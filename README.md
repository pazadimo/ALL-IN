# ALL-IN


This repository contains the Pytorch implementation and the used graph embeddings in "ALL-IN: A Local GLobal Graph-based DIstillatioN Model for Representation Learning of Gigapixel Histopathology Images With Application In Cancer Risk Assessment" paper, accepted at MICCAI 2023.

## Note
- Both the embeddings and training/testing codes will be available in this repository.
- We are currently in the process of code and data cleaning. Stay tuned!
  




## TODOs
Please follow this GitHub for more updates.
- [ ] Documentation on training and evaluating the models.
- [ ] Releasing the code post-training analyses including kaplan-meier plots and logrank tests
- [ ] Cleaning the  data to be ready for the public use.
- [ ] Publishing the pytorch implementation for all 3 distillation strategies presented in paper.
